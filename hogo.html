    <h1>History of FXS</h1>
   <p>FXS Entertainment is a semi-social platform that tries to entertain people. It started as a game on the Citadel gaming platform since December 12-13, 2024. The first appearance of the current site was on December 30 and was programmed by Youssef 140. We are now developing the site. Because it is a social site from the beginning, but Youssef 140 has some things, including exams and the unified, and when he completes them, he will seriously develop the site.</p>
